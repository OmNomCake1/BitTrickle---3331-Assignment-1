## Introduction
Basically, this is an interactive program where users can sign in to their accounts and upload and download files to/from the peer to peer network. Active peers, shared files, ports of active users and auth is managed by a server, which does not actively participate in the file sharing, but basically directs peers to other peers who can share the file needed.
